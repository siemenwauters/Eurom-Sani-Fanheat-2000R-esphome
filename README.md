To give the bathroom that extra boost in temperature when the woman of the house gets ready i needed a smart controlled heater that i could control from home assistant. 
Quickly it became clear that there is not really any decent wall heaters that have a wifi intergration other than some that use some non standard version of tuya.

Since those already cost a lot more just to add the wifi functionality to the heater i went on a path to build my own. The first attempt with a ir led to control a heater worked but was not relyable enough to my teste.
When i found a little heater that comes from a decent brand popped up on a local second hand site i jumped for the opportunity to get it at 15 euro since i did not need the warranty anyway with my modifications.

Below is a picture of the end result
